# Developer Tools — `/tools`

The Tools page (`app/(main)/tools/page.tsx`) is fully **public** — no login required for any tool, QR included. Nothing on the page or its APIs is gated by auth (`proxy.ts` does not match `/tools`, the page imports no auth hooks, and none of the tool endpoints call `getSessionFromRequest`).

Cards: **URL Shortener** · **Low Weight File Transfer** · **Text Share** · Meta Scraper (coming soon).

All three share the same result UX: a `.result-box` with the link + Copy button, a `ShortUrlQR` (160×160 white-card QR + "Download QR" PNG export), and live countdowns rendered from server timestamps (`formatCountdown` in `lib/textShareRules.ts` — `MM:SS`, or `H:MM:SS` for ≥ 1 hour).

### Persistence across refresh
Results survive page refreshes via `localStorage` (`lnkzoo_tools_state`, keyed per tool — last result of each tool). On load, entries whose `expiresAt` has not yet passed are restored with correct state: the destroy countdown resumes from the real server timestamp and the rate-limit cooldown ("Next request in…") restores from the stored `nextAllowedAt`. Expired entries are skipped and purged — results are destroyed only by their actual TTL, never by a refresh. Live destruction (countdown hitting 0) also removes the stored entry. The chosen expiry id is stored alongside the result too, so the restored card reports the right TTL instead of falling back to the default.

### Ownership for signed-in users
All three tools stay public, but a signed-in caller's output is recorded against their account (`user_id` on `shortened_links` / `temp_files` / `shared_texts`) and listed in the **Tool Links** section of their own profile with a live countdown and a Destroy button. Guests create the same rows with `user_id = NULL` and are never listed — anonymous use is unchanged and untracked.

- `GET /api/tools/items` — the caller's active items (short links, temp files, shared texts), newest first. 401 for guests.
- `DELETE /api/tools/items/[type]/[code]` — `type` is `short` | `file` | `text`. Owner-scoped: every statement carries `AND user_id = $me`, so a guessed code can never touch someone else's row. A file also destroys its Cloudinary asset, a short link stops resolving. 404 when not owned or already gone.
- Expiry is unchanged and still automatic; destroying early just frees the row (and the asset) sooner. Expired items drop out of the list on their own.
- Short links are deduplicated by URL, so a signed-in caller **claims** a live row that has no owner yet (`user_id IS NULL`); it never steals a row that already has one.

### "Make another" reset buttons
Each tool's result has a reset button that clears **only that tool** (result, countdown, storage entry) while other tools keep their state:
- URL Shortener → **Shorten another URL**
- Low Weight File Transfer → **Share another file**
- Text Share → **Share another text**

The rate-limit cooldown survives the reset, so the fresh form still shows "Next request in…" until the server allows another submission.

## 1. URL Shortener

| | |
|---|---|
| Endpoint | `POST /api/tools/shorten` (JSON `{ url }`) |
| Access | Public (guests 10/min, logged-in 30/min — in-memory `lib/rate-limit.ts`) |
| TTL | 24 hours, auto-expired (`shortened_links` table) |
| QR | `ShortUrlQR value={shortResult.shortUrl}` under the result box |

Returns `{ shortCode, shortUrl, expiresAt }` — link is `<appUrl>/s/<code>` and redirects via `app/s/[code]/page.tsx`. Reuses an existing non-expired row for the same URL; reactivates expired rows.

## 2. Low Weight File Transfer

| | |
|---|---|
| Endpoint | `POST /api/tools/upload-temp-file` (multipart `FormData`, fields `file` + `expiry`) |
| Access | Public — no auth, works for guests |
| Size cap | 3 MB — rejected early via `content-length` (413), re-checked after parse |
| Expiry | `5m` (5 min) · `1h` (1 hour) · `24h` (24 hours) — server-side allowlist, invalid → 400 |
| Rate limit | **1 upload / minute / IP** — DB-backed (`temp_file_limits`), returns `retryAfterMs` on 429 |
| UI | "This file will be destroyed in MM:SS" (hour-aware `H:MM:SS` for 24h) |
| QR | `ShortUrlQR` encodes `<appUrl>/f/<code>` |
| Files | `lib/tempFiles.ts`, `lib/tempFileRules.ts`, `styles/ui/temp-file.css` |
| DB | `docs/db/temp-file-transfer.md` |

### Flow
1. Client pre-checks (size, blocked extension), picks an expiry (5 min / 1 hour / 24 hours) → `FormData` POST with `file` + `expiry`.
2. Server: rate limit → `content-length` cap → parse `FormData` → expiry allowlist → size re-check → type blocklist → lazy prune of expired rows.
3. Uploaded to Cloudinary as `resource_type: 'raw'` base64 data URI (folder `lnkzoo_temp`) — the file **never touches server disk** and is never executed.
4. Row inserted with a random 10-char code; `expires_at = now + chosen TTL`.
5. `GET /f/[code]` proxies the file from Cloudinary with `Content-Disposition: attachment` using the **original filename** (UTF-8 fallback) and the stored `Content-Type`, plus `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. Expired/missing codes self-heal (Cloudinary asset destroyed + row deleted) then 404.

### Security model
- Files served only as forced downloads — the browser never renders them, so HTML/SVG/JS payloads can't execute.
- Type blocklist (html/htm/xhtml/svg/js/mjs/mhtml/hta — checked by extension **and** MIME): blocked uploads get *"This file type is blocked for security. Zip it and upload the .zip instead."*
- Filenames sanitized (`\ / : * ? " < > |` + control chars → `_`) so they can't inject into `Content-Disposition`.
- `/f/[code]` hits throttled per IP (30/min, in-memory) to slow code brute force; 10-char base62 codes (≈8×10¹⁷ space) can't be guessed inside the TTL.
- The Cloudinary CDN URL never reaches the client (server-side proxy only).
- Triple deletion guarantee: cron (`/api/cron/cleanup-temp-files`), lazy prune on every upload, self-heal on access.

## 3. Text Share

| | |
|---|---|
| Endpoint | `POST /api/tools/share-text` (JSON `{ content, expiry }`) |
| Access | Public — no auth, works for guests |
| Size cap | 10,000 chars, trimmed; empty → 400 |
| Expiry | `5m` (5 min) · `1h` (1 hour) · `24h` (24 hours) — server-side allowlist, invalid → 400 |
| Rate limit | **1 share / minute / IP** — DB-backed (`shared_text_limits`), returns `retryAfterMs` on 429 |
| UI | "This text will be destroyed in MM:SS" (hour-aware `H:MM:SS` for 24h) |
| QR | `ShortUrlQR` encodes `<appUrl>/t/<code>` |
| Files | `lib/textShare.ts`, `lib/textShareRules.ts`, `styles/ui/shared-text.css` |
| DB | `docs/db/text-share.md` |

### Flow
1. Client: char counter/limit, expiry segmented picker (5 min / 1 hour / 24 hours), `Share Text` button.
2. Server: expiry allowlist → length check → rate limit → lazy prune → insert with chosen TTL.
3. `GET /t/[code]` renders the text in a scrollable `<pre>` (React-escaped — never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`), shows the destroy time, plus Copy and home link. Expired/missing codes self-heal (row deleted) then 404; hits throttled per IP (30/min).

### Cleanup
`GET /api/cron/cleanup-shared-texts` — `DELETE FROM shared_texts WHERE expires_at <= NOW()`, works even when nobody visits. Both cleanup crons require header `x-cron-secret` = `CRON_SECRET` env (fail-open if the env is unset so local dev keeps working).

## Shared components

- **`components/common/ShortUrlQR.tsx`** — `qrcode.react` `<QRCodeCanvas>` (160×160, black on white so it scans in dark mode) in a fixed 180×180 white card + "Download QR" button (canvas → PNG). Centered; `styles/ui/qr.css`.
- **`lib/textShareRules.ts`** — shared pure constants/helpers used by client and server: `MAX_SHARED_TEXT_CHARS`, `TEXT_SHARE_EXPIRY_OPTIONS`, `formatCountdown`.
- **`lib/tempFileRules.ts`** — shared pure constants/helpers: `MAX_TEMP_FILE_BYTES`, `TEMP_FILE_EXPIRY_OPTIONS`, `DEFAULT_TEMP_FILE_EXPIRY`, blocked extension/MIME lists, `tempFileExt`, `isBlockedTempFile`, `formatBytes`.
- **`services/toolItems.service.ts`** — `listToolItems(userId)` (UNION ALL over the three tables) and `destroyToolItem(userId, type, code)` (owner-scoped destroy).
- **`components/profile/ToolItems.tsx`** — the profile **Tool Links** section (own profile only), with one shared 1s ticker driving every countdown.

## Environment

- Cloudinary: `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` (already used by image uploads).
- `CRON_SECRET` — protects the two cleanup crons.
- No new env needed for the tools themselves.
